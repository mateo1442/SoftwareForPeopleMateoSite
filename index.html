                <div class="overlay">Hi and welcome to my collection of messages left in the Sterling Memorial Library card catalogues. As a bit of background, Sterling Memorial Library was designed by James Gamble Rogers in 1930, in the collegiate Gothic Style which took its roots from Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom. When it was first opened, patrons would visit the card catalogues in the library lobby and find the card corresponding to whatever reference materials you were looking for. They would then hand this physical card over to a librarian who would call for it via pneumatic tubes-which can still be seen around the Sterling stacks. Since the pneumatic tube system was discontinued, and the card catalogue was digitized, the card catalogue cabinets have remained empty, save for a collection of notes from tourists, students, professors, and anyone else who may visit Yale. In a way, it is an analog form of social media, wherein one opens a cabinet, reads a message, and if they so desire, they may leave one as well. Some messages are encouraging, others are aspirational, and some-as is true with all forms of social media-are just crass jokes. Here I have collected some of my favorites that I have found, so please enjoy browsing one of my favorite Yale discoveries.</div>
